            <p> Here I am in this strange country about which I have learned in the
            geography and history, and about which I heard my father talk. The
            daughter of an American man and a Chinese woman, I suppose I am what is
            called a mongrel. My father was a Commissioner of Customs in China, and
            living for years in that country he fell in love with my mother and
            married her--as was natural. Who could help falling in love with my
            dear, yellow, winsome, little mother? My name is Margaret, called after
            my father's mother; my father said that the word Margaret means a pearl,
            so he gave me the pet name "Pearl." Dear father!
            
            "It was a monstrous thing for Brother George to marry away there," I
            overheard my Aunt Gwendolin remark a short time after my arrival. "Why
            could he not have come back home to his own country and found a
            wife?--And above all to have married a heathen Chinese!"
            
            "Not a heathen," said my grandmother, reproachfully, "she had previously
            embraced the faith of Europeans; so my dear George wrote me from that
            far-away country."
            
            "Oh, they are all heathens in my estimation," cried my Aunt Gwendolin,
            scornfully; "what faith they embrace does not change the fact that they
            belong to the yellow people."
            
            My mother died while I was yet a child, and my father has died and left
            me alone in the world within the last year. Grandmother, my father's
            mother, when she learned about her son's death, sent at once for me.
            
            "I cannot leave a granddaughter of mine in that country, and among that
            heathen, if not barbarous, people," she wrote to the American consul,
            "and I ask your services to assist her to come to my home in America."
            
            The consul, absent-minded, gave me my grandmother's letter to read, and
            thus I learned her feeling about my mother's people and country. I never
            would have come to this horrible America if I could have helped myself;
            but I am scarcely of age, and by my father's will grandmother is
            appointed my guardian.
            
            The result of it all is, that having crossed the intervening waters, I
            am here in the home of my grandmother, my Aunt Gwendolin and my Uncle
            Theodore Morgan.
            
            When I arrived this morning I was ushered into the sitting-room by a
            maid, and the first one I beheld was my grandmother, sitting in a
            rocking-chair. She called me to her, and crossing the room, I kotowed to
            her, that is I went down on my hands and knees and touched my forehead
            to the floor, as my Chinese nurse had taught me when I was yet a baby
            that I should always do when I came into the presence of an elderly
            woman, a mother of children.
            
            "My _dear_ grandchild!" cried my grandmother, "_do_ get up. All you
            should do is to kiss me--your grandmother!" And she put out her hand and
            assisted me from the floor.
            
            Grandmother is the dearest, prettiest little woman I ever saw, with
            white hair and the brightest of eyes, and I have to love her, although I
            had made up my mind to hate everything in America. A moment after she
            had lifted me from the floor, my Aunt Gwendolin came in. She is tall and
            thin, not nearly so beautiful a woman as my Chinese mother. She wears
            skirts that drag on the floor, and her hair is built up into a sort of a
            mountain on top of her head. I am reminded every time I look at her of a
            certain peak in the Thian Shan mountains. I very much prefer little
            women, like my own dear mother, like the women of my own country.
            
            My Uncle Theodore is long-armed, long-legged, long-bodied. He looks a
            little like my father, and for that reason I hate him a little less than
            my Aunt Gwendolin.
            
            After my mother's death, my father brought into our home a French
            governess, daughter of a French consul, to teach me. Father seemed to
            be lost in his business, or his grief at the loss of my mother, and paid
            very little heed to me after the arrival of the governess.
            
            "She is an educated woman," he told me when he had engaged her, "and I
            want her to teach you all you could learn in a first-class girls' school
            in Europe or America."
            
            After that the French governess spent hours with me every day, and I saw
            my father only at intervals. How much we talked about, that French lady
            and I! Everything, almost, except religion; _that_ my father vetoed, as
            her faith was not the one he wished me to embrace. "I'll take you over
            to your grandmother by and by," he used to say, "to get the proper
            religious instruction."
            
            The governess said that I inherited more from my father's side of the
            house than my mother's; that although I was born in China, I was more
            of an Occidental than an Oriental; more than once she said that my
            American mannerisms and tricks of speech were really remarkable, and
            that I was a living example of the power of heredity. But I am never
            going back on my mother's people, _never_, my dear little oval-faced
            mother whose grave is under a spreading camphor tree at the heart of the
            world.
            
            Does it not mean something that China is at the centre of the world--the
            kernel?
            
            "The girl is not bad to look at, in fact I think she is a beauty--a face
            filled with the indescribable dash of the Orient," said my Uncle
            Theodore, when they were talking me over in the sitting-room after I had
            retired to my chamber upstairs. Evidently they had forgotten the
            opening in the floor which had been left by the workmen while making
            some changes in the plumbing. And they did not know my extraordinary
            keenness of hearing, which my governess said was an Oriental trait.
            
            It seemed to give my governess some pleasure to talk about that keen
            sense of the Orientals, and to speculate as to how they had acquired it.
            "They have lived in a country where it is necessary, for
            self-protection, to hear all that is being plotted and planned," she
            said, "a country of conspiracies and intrigues, of plots and
            counterplots. Centuries of this have developed abnormal hearing."
            
            "She has a superb figure," said my uncle, continuing to talk about me,
            "and that oval face of hers, with her creamy complexion, is really
            bewitching."
            
            "Yellow! you mean, _yellow_!" interrupted my Aunt Gwendolin; "she's
            entirely too yellow for beauty. I'm terribly afraid that some of our set
            will discover her nationality. That's _one_ thing you must remember,
            Theodore, nobody on this continent is ever to learn anything about her
            Chinese blood. They are so despised here as a race. She is our brother's
            daughter, with some foreign strain inherited from her mother; that
            is enough; never, _never_, let us acknowledge the Chinese. The
            Italians and Spanish are yellowish too,--I have it!" she exclaimed,
            "_Spanish!_--Spanish will do!--Some of those are _our_ people now, you
            know! It will be quite interesting to have her a native of one of our
            Dependencies--a descendant of some old Spanish family!"
